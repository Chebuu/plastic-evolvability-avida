# 2020-08-28 Population Dynamics

The goal of these runs is to establish baseline expectations for population dynamics.

Details

- Experimental design: single phase (if noisy, move to double phase)
- Environmental change rates: u0 (constant), u3, u10, u30, u100, u300, u1000
- Sensors: sensors+, sensors-
- Questions/analyses
  - Is there a difference between sensors+, sensors- for a given change rate?
  - Are sensors+ populations more similar to constant (sensors-)?
- Axes of comparison
  - MRCA changes (selective sweeps)
  - Standing variation (number of distinct genotypes) over time
  - Phylogenetic diversity
- Number of replicates: 50

Some concerns

- Should we be collecting data at a higher resolution to better capture u3/u10/u30 temporal dynamics?
