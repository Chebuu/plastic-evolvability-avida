# 2020-10-12 Bottlenecking Exploratory Experiment

Subject plastic and constant-reward populations to periodic population bottlenecks.

Takeaway(s)

- Bottlenecking populations down to 50, 20, and 10% population size does not seem to have an effect on task performance (or discovery).
- Should we be bottlenecking down to 5 or 1%?
